# Second-Level File System for Linux

This is a second-level file system designed for Linux, implemented in C programming language. It includes a main function that initializes the file system and provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the file system.

## Usage

To use this file system, compile the source code files  `main.cpp` using a C compiler. Then, run the resulting executable file.

Once the file system is running, you can log in using your username and password. After logging in, you can use various commands to interact with the file system, such as creating new files, deleting files, and changing directories. Type `help` to see a list of available commands.
